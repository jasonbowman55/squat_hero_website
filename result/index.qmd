Demo day is the final day of Micro Ps where we can show off our creation to all students and faculty who want to come. Below you can see the final setup we had ready for demo day, as well as a video of our instructor, [Professor Josh Brake](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbrake/) demoing our device.

Demo day was a blast, and we hope everyone enjoyed their experience. If you did not get to try out the Squat Hero product, stay tuned because this is not the end! :)
