Welcome to our final project for Micro Ps! A class at Harvey Mudd College focused on Microprocessor and FPGA design and application.

This project focused on implementing MCU and FPGA functionalities to measure joint angles using IMUs and display a figure on a screen via VGA, providing insights into the userâ€™s squat depth. Tracking body motion is a foundational step in developing many kinematic solutions and serves as the initial phase of a long-term project, further detailed in the Project Ideation tab.
