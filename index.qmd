Welcome to our final project for Micro Ps! A class at Harvey Mudd College focused on Microprocessor and FPGA design and application.

This project was focused on implamenting FPGA and MCU functionalities in order to measure joint angles using IMUs and display a side profile stick figure to a screen via vga cable. Tracking body motion is the first step to many kinematic solutions, and will hopefully be the first steps towards a long desired project further explained in the project ideation tab.
