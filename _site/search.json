Tracking body motion is the first step to many kinematic solutions, and will hopefully be the first steps towards a long desired project further explained in the project ideation tab."

    "text": "The inspiration for this project came from an idea Jason had in high school while helping middle school students learn proper squat technique. The initial concept was to design a lightweight exoskeleton using motors to apply gentle resistance, guiding users through the ideal squat motion. Unlike traditional exoskeletons, this design would focus on being lightweight, affordable, and non-intrusive. Instead of doing the work for the user, it would act as a guide, helping them develop proper form without overly relying on external assistance. This approach would provide accessible and new-age fitness technology to a broad audience, including personal trainers working to enhance client performance, physical therapists helping patients recover from injuries, athletes refining their technique, and even beginners looking to build confidence and prevent injuries. By prioritizing simplicity and affordability, the design aims to maximize training time and allow the quantification of the squat form to be used for feedback training.\n\n\n\nGeneralization of squat form, image source\n\n\nThis project is an essential stepping stone in our knowledge and product development, aiming to ultimately provide a useful final product to a client. In the scope of Micro Ps, we are integrating IMU functionality, similar to what will be found in the final product, with an FPGA-driving VGA to create a game interface, further details of which can be found under the software section of the website. We chose to use IMUs for position decomposition due to their lightweight and simple-to-use interface, which eliminates the need for extensive mechanical design and complex user calibration associated with hardware-centric potentiometer decoding. Future implementations may include IMU-controlled feedback motors for selected leg joints, enhancing the overall functionality and usability of the system."

    "text": "The mechanical design for this project was minimal, given the scope of the class. The only thing that needed to be designed was the housing units for each IMU, which allow for the IMUs to be strapped to the body using velcro straps, hold the IMU in a predefined direction, be comfortable for the wearer, and allow access to the STEMMA quick connect terminals. The final result of the IMU mounts is seen below.\n FINAL DRAWINGS AND CAD MODELS + WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN WORN ON SOMEONE\nThe final product features Squat Hero labeling, labels telling where to put it on the body, and an indication of the configured chip address for clarity. This helps minimize confusion.\nEven though this is an embedded systems class, the prototype timeline can be seen below as a tribute to the engineering process. Significant changes from the original design include: - features to make tolerancing fit the IMU better - smoothing out the edges for user comfort and - sufficient labeling to help reduce any confusion\n INSERT PROTOTYPE TIMELINE PICTURES!"
