## VGA Protocol
As part of this project we make use of a simplified VGA protocol consisting of the following signals:
- 4-bit color data (r, g, b)
- Horizontal sync (hs)
- Vertical sync (vs)

TODO: explain how this protocol works

### DAC Design
As part of the VGA design, we needed to convert the 4-bit color data from the MCU into analog signals with a voltage range of 0-0.7V. 
This was done using a custom DAC design, comprising of resistors of values 1kΩ, 2kΩ, 4kΩ, 8kΩ, and 16kΩ. Given a 3.3V digital input for 
each bit along with a 75Ω impedance assumed on the VGA's ADC we can expect the following calculated equation to represent voltage outputs TODO: add equation

## Parallel Communication Interface
We used 3 I/O pins to send a series of 9 different signals to the FPGA. This would then be interpreted by the FPGA to control which framebuffer to display.
