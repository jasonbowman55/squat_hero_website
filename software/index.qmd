THIS WILL HAVE AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT THIS SECTION TALKS ABOUT AND MAYBE WHY WE DO WHAT THINGS ON THE MCU/FPGA RESPECTIVELY.

THINGS WE DID ON THE MCU
- READ DATA WITH I2C
- CONVERTED TO USABLE DATA
- GENERATED A STATUS BIT TO INDICATE FULL SQUAT
- SEND DATA WITH SPI

THINGS WE DID ON THE FPGA
- READ DATA FROM SPI
- DECODE DATA AND GENERATE LINES READABLE THROUGH VGA
- DISPLAY VIA VGA CONNECTOR
