title: Mechanical Design
---

The mechanical design for this project was minimal, given the scope of the class. The only thing that needed to be designed was the housing units for each IMU, which allow for the IMUs to be strapped to the body using velcro straps, hold the IMU in a predefined direction, be comfortable for the wearer, and allow access to the STEMMA quick connect terminals. The final result of the IMU mounts is seen below.

The final product features Squat Hero labeling, labels telling where to put it on the body, and an indication of the configured chip address for clarity. This helps minimize confusion.

Even though this is an embedded systems class, the prototype timeline can be seen below as a tribute to the engineering process. Significant changes from the original design include:
- features to make tolerancing fit the IMU better
- smoothing out the edges for user comfort and
- sufficient labeling to help reduce any confusion
